# First-Aid-Application-Project
The First Aid Application is a platform for managing rescue workers and their assignments. Rescuers can register, declare their skills (PSE1, PSE2, SSA, etc.), and view their deployments, while administrators manage competencies and automatically assign duties using an algorithm based on skills and availability.
